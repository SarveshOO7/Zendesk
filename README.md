# TicketViewer by Sarvesh Tandon
Kindly take into consideration that I had a 101 F since 23rd September and a midterm before that
while evaluating my project.

I have used python 3.8.2 for the CLI version of this project.

## Installation
For Debian GNU/Linux distros like Ubuntu:
<br>
    Run the following commands
      
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    sudo apt install python3.8
    pip install requests
    pip install -U pytest
   

## Usage
To run the program, run the following command in the terminal: `python3 main.py`
<br>
To run tests, run the following command in the terminal: `pytest test.py`
